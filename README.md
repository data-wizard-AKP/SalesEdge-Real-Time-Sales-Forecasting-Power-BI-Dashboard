##  Problem Statement

Retail managers at a fictional superstore lacked a unified view of their sales performance across geographies, customer segments, and product categories. Decision-making was hindered by fragmented reports and limited visibility into trends and operational metrics.

---

## 🎯 Task

Design an interactive and insightful dashboard that:

- Aggregates sales, profit, and quantity data across multiple dimensions
- Highlights regional and segment-wise performance
- Tracks year-over-year trends and seasonal patterns
- Identifies top-performing categories and sub-categories
- Provides actionable insights for business strategy

---

## 💡 Solution

Using **Power BI**, I developed a dynamic dashboard that integrates multiple views and filters to enable deep exploration of sales data. Key features include:

- 📍 **Regional Analysis**: Sales breakdown across Central, East, South, and West
- 💳 **Payment Mode Distribution**: Cards, COD, and Online
- 📅 **YoY Trends**: Monthly comparisons for 2019 and 2020
- 📦 **Sub-Category Performance**: Phones, Chairs, Binders, etc.
- 🚚 **Shipping Insights**: Average ship days and mode-wise analysis
- 🔐 **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Role-based access using `USERPRINCIPALNAME()`
- ⚡ **Optimized Data Model**: Streamlined for performance and interactivity

---

## 📈 Insights

- 🔹 **West Region** leads with **33.37%** of total sales
- 🔹 **COD** is the most preferred payment method (**42.62%**)
- 🔹 **Phones** and **Chairs** are top-selling sub-categories
- 🔹 **Corporate Segment** contributes **32.55%** of total sales
